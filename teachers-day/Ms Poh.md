    "Good Morning" we say to you everyday
    but we dont feel bored or annoyed
    your aura is always very strong
    once you step into the class there's 'peace'.
    your jokes always lose the peacefulness
    but we like it
    suddenly,
    "bam" 
    goes the reminder of silence
    as your waterbottle slams the table
    we wouldnt be surprised if the table breaks one day and not your waterbottle
    as your lesson goes, your high pitched voice reverbrates through the air
    maybe our ears will get used to it one day
    but for now it removes our sleepiness
