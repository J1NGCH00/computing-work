    "Good Morning" we say that to you everyday
    but we dont feel bored or annoyed
    your aura is always very strong
    once you step into the class there's 'peace'
    but your jokes always lose the peacefulness
    but we like it
    suddenly, "bam" goes the reminder of silence
    as your waterbottle slams the table
    we wouldnt be amused if the table breaks one day and not your waterbottle.
    as lesson goes, your high pitched voice reverberated through the air.
    maybe our ears will get used to it one day. 
    and it also removes our sleepiness.
